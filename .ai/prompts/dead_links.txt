# Prompt: dead_links v1.0.0
Given a JSON array of broken links with files/lines, produce a unified diff
that fixes or removes the links with the least invasive change. If a link
is important but the target is truly gone, add a short footnote "(reference archived)"
and point to the Wayback snapshot if available.
If zero fixes are meaningful, output: NOOP

# Quick Fix for Playwright Implementation

## Issue
The PowerShell class syntax requires types to be available at parse time, but Playwright DLL isn't loaded until runtime. This causes "Unable to find type" errors.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Script Blocks Instead of Classes (Recommended for now)
Convert PlaywrightWrapper from a class to a hashtable-based object with script blocks.

### Option 2: Pre-load DLL in Profile
Add DLL loading to PowerShell profile, but this requires user configuration.

### Option 3: Use C# Add-Type
Create a C# wrapper class and load it dynamically.

## Current Status
- ✅ Playwright DLL successfully installed to `packages/lib/`
- ✅ DLL can be loaded manually
- ❌ Class-based wrapper fails due to parse-time type resolution
- ⚠️ Browser binaries not installed (but not required for basic testing)

## Immediate Workaround
For now, users can test Playwright by:
1. Manually loading the DLL
2. Using Playwright API directly without the wrapper class

## Next Steps
Implement Option 1 (script block approach) for production use.

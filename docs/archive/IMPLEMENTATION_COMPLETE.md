## 🎓 Knowledge Transfer

### Key Concepts

1. **Playwright vs Selenium**
   - Playwright: Modern, actively developed, better JavaScript support
   - Selenium: Legacy, compatibility issues, slower

2. **PlaywrightWrapper Class**
   - Encapsulates all Playwright operations
   - Handles initialization, navigation, cleanup
   - Provides PowerShell-friendly interface

3. **Automatic Routing**
   - MSRC URLs → Playwright
   - GitHub URLs → API
   - Other URLs → Standard HTTP

4. **Graceful Fallback**
   - Playwright not installed → Warning + HTTP fallback
   - Playwright fails → Error + HTTP fallback
   - Always continues scraping

### Code Patterns

```powershell
# Pattern 1: Using Playwright
$playwright = [PlaywrightWrapper]::new()
try {
    if ($playwright.Initialize()) {
        $result = $playwright.NavigateToPage($url, 8)
        # Use $result.Content
    }
} finally {
    $playwright.Dispose()
}

# Pattern 2: Checking availability
if (Test-PlaywrightAvailability) {
    # Use Playwright
} else {
    # Use fallback
}

# Pattern 3: Error handling
$result = Get-MSRCPageWithPlaywright -Url $url
if ($result.Success) {
    # Process content
} elseif ($result.RequiresPlaywright) {
    # Show installation instructions
} else {
    # Handle other errors
}
```

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

---

### 1. Playwright Installation for CVExpand.ps1
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Issue:**
- Playwright not installed, preventing JavaScript-heavy page scraping
- MSRC pages requiring JavaScript rendering were not fully functional

**Resolution:**
- Fixed `Install-Playwright.ps1` syntax errors:
  - Completed missing `Install-PlaywrightBrowsers` function
  - Fixed broken `Test-PlaywrightInstallation` function
  - Removed duplicate/malformed code sections
- Successfully installed Playwright:
  - Playwright DLL installed to `packages/lib/Microsoft.Playwright.dll`
  - Assembly verification successful
  - Ready for enhanced web scraping

**Installation Details:**
```
Location: C:\Users\viral\OneDrive\Desktop\CVExcel\CVExcel\packages
Status: ‚úÖ Playwright assembly loaded successfully
```

**Impact:**
- CVExpand.ps1 can now scrape JavaScript-heavy vendor advisory pages
- Enhanced MSRC data extraction capabilities
- Full vendor-specific module support enabled

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Recommendations

### Medium Priority Items

#### 1. Test Suite Updates
**Status:** Needs Attention

**Issues:**
- Test paths may reference incorrect vendor module locations
- Some test files may be missing or outdated
- Vendor module dependency loading needs verification

**Recommended Actions:**
```powershell
# Update test paths
# Ensure all vendor modules are properly referenced
# Verify dependency loading order
# Create missing test files or remove invalid references
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (not critical for core functionality)

---

#### 2. Vendor Module Dependencies
**Status:** Investigation Needed

**Issues:**
- Potential circular dependency issues in vendor module loading
- Class loading order may need optimization

**Recommended Actions:**
- Review vendor module dependency chain
- Implement proper dependency injection pattern
- Ensure proper class loading order

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### Low Priority Items

#### 3. Documentation Updates
**Status:** Ongoing

**Current State:**
- Core documentation exists
- API reference available
- Implementation guides complete

**Recommended:**
- Update installation guides with Playwright steps
- Add troubleshooting sections
- Expand examples and use cases

**Priority:** LOW

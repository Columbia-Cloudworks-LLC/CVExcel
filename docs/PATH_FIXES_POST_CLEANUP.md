# Path Fixes After Project Cleanup

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and Verified

---

## üêõ Issues Found

After reorganizing the project structure, several path references needed updating because files were moved from root to subfolders.

### Issue 1: PlaywrightWrapper.ps1 Not Found
**Error:**
```
The term 'C:\Users\viral\OneDrive\Desktop\CVExcel\PlaywrightWrapper.ps1' is not recognized
At C:\Users\viral\OneDrive\Desktop\CVExcel\CVExpand.ps1:46 char:3
+ . "$PSScriptRoot\PlaywrightWrapper.ps1"
```

**Cause:** `PlaywrightWrapper.ps1` was moved from root to `/ui` folder during cleanup, but `CVExpand.ps1` was still referencing the old location.

**Fix:** Updated line 46 in `CVExpand.ps1`:
```powershell
# Before
. "$PSScriptRoot\PlaywrightWrapper.ps1"

# After
. "$PSScriptRoot\ui\PlaywrightWrapper.ps1"
```

### Issue 2: HTTP Header Error
**Error:**
```
Failed to fetch page with HTTP: Keep-Alive and Close may not be set using this property.
Parameter name: value
```

**Cause:** PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest` doesn't allow setting the `Connection` header directly - it's a reserved/restricted header managed by the framework.

**Fix:** Removed the `Connection` header from the HTTP request headers in `CVExpand.ps1`:
```powershell
# Before
$headers = @{
    'User-Agent'                = '...'
    'Connection'                = 'keep-alive'  # This line caused the error
    'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests' = '1'
}

# After
$headers = @{
    'User-Agent'                = '...'
    'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests' = '1'
}
```

### Issue 3: Playwright DLL Path Wrong
**Error:**
```
WARNING: Playwright DLL not found at: C:\Users\viral\OneDrive\Desktop\CVExcel\ui\packages\lib\Microsoft.Playwright.dll
```

**Cause:** After moving `PlaywrightWrapper.ps1` to `/ui` folder, `$PSScriptRoot` now pointed to the ui directory, so it was looking for `ui/packages/` instead of root `packages/`.

**Fix:** Updated `ui/PlaywrightWrapper.ps1` to look for packages in the root directory:
```powershell
# Before
$packageDir = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "packages"

# After
# packages folder is in root directory (one level up from ui/)
$rootDir = Split-Path $PSScriptRoot -Parent
$packageDir = Join-Path $rootDir "packages"
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened
During the project cleanup, files were moved to organize the structure:
- **GUI modules** ‚Üí `/ui` folder
- **Test scripts** ‚Üí `/tests` folder
- **Documentation** ‚Üí `/docs` folder

However, **relative path references** in scripts needed updating to reflect the new locations. PowerShell's `$PSScriptRoot` variable returns the directory containing the script, so when scripts move, their `$PSScriptRoot` changes.

### Prevention for Future
When moving PowerShell scripts:
1. **Search for path references** - Check for `.` (dot-sourcing), `Join-Path`, file paths
2. **Test after moving** - Run scripts to verify they still work
3. **Consider relative paths** - Use `Split-Path` to navigate up directories when needed
4. **Check $PSScriptRoot usage** - This variable changes when scripts are moved

## üéØ Lessons Learned

### PowerShell Specifics
1. **Reserved Headers** - Some HTTP headers cannot be set directly in `Invoke-WebRequest`:
   - `Connection`
   - `Content-Length`
   - `Host`
   - `Transfer-Encoding`
   - Let PowerShell manage these automatically

2. **$PSScriptRoot** - Always refers to the directory containing the current script:
   ```powershell
   # Root script: $PSScriptRoot = C:\Project
   # ui\script.ps1: $PSScriptRoot = C:\Project\ui
   # Use Split-Path to navigate up: Split-Path $PSScriptRoot -Parent
   ```

3. **Dot-Sourcing** - When using `. "path\to\script.ps1"`, the path must be correct relative to caller's location

### Project Organization
- **Trade-offs** - Better organization may require path updates
- **Testing** - Always test after structural changes
- **Documentation** - Document path dependencies
- **Centralization** - Consider using a module/loader pattern to avoid scattered imports

# CVExcel Project Overview

## Project Context
This is a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data scraping project that:
- Scrapes vendor advisory pages for vulnerability information
- Uses PowerShell for automation and data processing
- Implements Playwright for JavaScript-heavy web scraping
- Follows NIST security guidelines for secure coding practices
- Uses modular vendor-specific scraping classes

## Core Principles
1. **Security First** - All code must follow NIST security guidelines
2. **PowerShell Best Practices** - Follow Microsoft's recommended patterns
3. **Playwright Excellence** - Use modern testing and automation practices
4. **Maintainability** - Write clean, documented, and modular code
5. **Error Handling** - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging

## Project Structure
- `vendors/` - Modular vendor-specific scraping classes
- `tests/` - Automated testing suite using Pester and Playwright
- `out/` - Output directory for scraped data (CSV format)
- `docs/` - Project documentation and guides
- `config/` - Configuration files and settings

## Key Technologies
- **PowerShell** - Primary scripting language with advanced function patterns
- **Playwright** - Web automation and testing framework
- **PSScriptAnalyzer** - Code quality and security analysis
- **Pester** - PowerShell testing framework

## Security Requirements
- Follow NIST SP 800-53 security controls
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use secure coding practices for all web scraping operations
- Maintain audit trails and comprehensive logging
- Handle sensitive data according to security guidelines

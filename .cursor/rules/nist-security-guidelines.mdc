# NIST Security Guidelines

## Secure Coding Standards
- Implement input validation for all user-provided data
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements to prevent injection
- Validate file paths and URLs to prevent directory traversal
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks
- Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- Implement proper session management and timeout controls
- Log security-relevant events for audit trails

## Access Control
- Follow principle of least privilege - grant minimum necessary permissions
- Implement role-based access control where applicable
- Use strong authentication mechanisms
- Implement proper authorization checks before sensitive operations
- Use secure defaults - deny access by default, grant explicitly

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048+)
- Implement proper key management practices
- Use secure random number generation for cryptographic operations
- Implement data retention and disposal policies
- Mask or redact sensitive information in logs

## Vulnerability Management
- Keep all dependencies and frameworks updated
- Use static code analysis tools (PSScriptAnalyzer, SonarQube)
- Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Perform regular security code reviews
- Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable packages
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information disclosure

## NIST Framework Compliance
- Implement Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover functions
- Follow NIST SP 800-53 security controls where applicable
- Implement proper risk management practices
- Maintain security documentation and procedures
- Regular security assessments and updates

## Industry Standards
- Follow OWASP secure coding practices
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use industry-standard encryption and security protocols
- Follow data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) where applicable
- Implement proper incident response procedures

## Logging and Monitoring
- Implement structured logging with consistent format
- Include timestamps, log levels, and context information
- Log all significant operations (start, end, errors, warnings)
- Implement log rotation and cleanup
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
- Include correlation IDs for tracking related operations
